		 * Converts a plain vanilla object to be an instance of the class

		 * deeply nested objects, you first need to convert the nested

		 * TODO: This method can be improved by making it recursive.  This would be 
		 * done by looking at the typeInfo returned from describeType and determining
		 * which properties represent custom classes.  Those classes would then
		 * be registerClassAlias'd using getDefinititonByName to get a reference,
		 * and then objectToInstance would be called on those properties to complete
		 * the recursive algorithm.
